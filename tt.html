      <p>Purpose</p>
     <ol>
      <li>Faster Access to Frequently Used Data
        <ul>
          <li> stores frequently accessed data and instructions from the main memory (RAM)</li>
          <li> Since accessing data from the cache is faster than fetching it from RAM, <br>it helps reduce the time taken to access frequently used information.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Reducing Memory Latency
        <ul>
          <li> is much faster than main memory, which means that it can provide quicker access to data</li>
          <li> helps in reducing memory latency, which is the time it takes to retrieve data from the memory subsystem</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Improving CPU Performance
        <ul>
          <li>By providing a faster access layer for the CPU, cache memory helps improve overall processor performance</li>
          <li>The CPU can fetch data and instructions more quickly, allowing for faster execution of programs.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Optimizing Data Transfer Speeds
        <ul>
          <li>Cache memory acts as a buffer between the slower main memory and the faster CPU</li>
          <li> It helps smooth out the differences in data transfer speeds between the CPU and RAM.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Temporary Storage of Data
        <ol>
          <li>Cache memory temporarily stores copies of frequently accessed data</li>
          <li>This temporary storage allows for quick retrieval of data without the need to access the slower main memory every time.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
